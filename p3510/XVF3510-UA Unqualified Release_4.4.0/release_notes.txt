Release Notes: XVF3510-UA and XVF3510-INT firmware version 4.4.0 (release candidate 1: build 210320 181801)
==============================================================================================================


Introduction
============

This note describes the version 4.4.0 release of the XVF3510 firmware. Except where explicitly mentioned, these release notes are relevant to both the -INT and -UA variants of the release. This version can be installed as a new factory image or as a DFU upgrade over versions 4.0.0 and onwards. This release is not compatible as a DFU upgrade over factory images prior to version 4.0.0.


How do I know if I have this software?
======================================

Using the appropriate vfctrl for your host (MAC, Win32, Linux or Pi) and control interface (i2c or usb) do:

GET_VERSION
Should respond: v4.4.0

GET_BLD_HOST
Should respond: Jenkins

GET_BLD_REPO_HASH
Should respond: 126b44

GET_BLD_XGIT_VIEW
Should respond: sw_xvf3510_master

GET_BLD_XGIT_HASH
Should respond: b70280

GET_BLD_MODIFIED
Should respond: false

If all of these results are as given above you have the official XVF3510 firmware version 4.4.0 release. All of these results are given within the first few lines of a parameter dump (the -d option for vfctrl).


What's in this release?
=======================

This release contains firmware binaries, host executables, and data partitions. Source code to allow the recompilation of host code and data partitions is also included.


What's new in Version 4.4.0?
============================

The following list summarises changes that may be observed when using Version 4.4.0 of this firmware in comparison to the previously released versions. A full changelog is also included in the release package.

Introduce support for XS3
-------------------------

Several source code libraries can be compiled for both XS2 and XS3, see the changelog for a detailed list of changes to source code libraries.

Improvements for AEC
--------------------

Applying window before adaptation to remove discontinuities on frame boundaries on the impulse response. This will improve the performance in cancelling the echo produced by Skype ringtone.

Improvements for AGC
--------------------

Update loss-control constants in Comms output to soften attenuation during double-talk.

Known issues in this release
============================

1. When used in a hybrid system implementing processed audio to the host over USB but reference audio over I2S, the XVF3510-UA still implements both USB audio in and out channels. This is known to cause issues with some USB host operating systems due to default audio path switching.
Workaround:
Configure your host to explicitly output audio to the correct audio interface.

2. The data image generation loses the sign bit on Raspberry Pi.
Workaround:
Data image generation should be done on desktop host, not Raspberry PI as the MSB of the Flashing register needs to be set.

3. The output filters are configured for 48kSamples/s operation.
Workaround:
16kSamples/s outputs should utilise coefficients for a 48k Samples/s filter and should expect outputs to be directly decimated by three.

4. The serial number feature is not supported by the INT build.
Workaround:
None.
